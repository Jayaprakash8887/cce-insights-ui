# CCE Insights UI

**Analytics dashboard** for the Clinical Care Engine (CCE) platform. Consumes REST endpoints from the CCE Insights Service to provide compliance analytics, deviation trends, event volume metrics, facility rankings, practitioner analytics, intelligence delivery monitoring, and ingestion pipeline monitoring. Compliance categories are binary: **Compliant** (`on_track`) and **Non-Compliant** (`non_compliant`). Default date range: **180 days**.

## Architecture

```
# Demo (local Docker — no gateway)
Browser → :3001 → Caddy (cce-insights-ui container)
                    ├── static assets (React SPA)
                    └── /v1/insights/* → proxy → cce-insights-service:8084 → PostgreSQL (read-only)

# Production (with gateway)
Browser → :3001 → CCE Gateway (OAuth, :8060) → Insights Service (:8084) → PostgreSQL (read-only)
```

| Component | Technology |

| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript 5 |
| Build | Vite 6 |
| Routing | React Router 7 |
| Server State | TanStack Query 5 |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS 4 |
| Charts | Recharts 2 |

npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3001
```

## Pages (12 routes)

| Route | Page | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `/` | Dashboard | Overview metrics (Tracked Cohort, Compliant/Non-Compliant Care Journeys), trend sparklines |
| `/compliance` | Compliance Overview | Protocol compliance summary, vertical timeline (Service Workflow Compliance), patient list |
| `/compliance/protocols/:id` | Protocol Analytics | Step analytics, completion funnel, outcomes, enrollment trends |
| `/compliance/patients` | Patient List | Patients by compliance status (Compliant/Non-Compliant only) |
| `/compliance/patients/:id` | Patient Detail | Timeline, protocol journey with source color-coded pills, events, deviations |
| `/deviations` | Deviations | Trends, most-deviated steps, resolution rate |
| `/events` | Event Volume | Volume by resource type and facility |
| `/facilities` | Facility Analytics | Facility rankings, color-coded compliance, non-compliant hotspots |
| `/practitioners` | Practitioner Analytics | Practitioner compliance table with color-coded legend |
| `/intelligence` | Intelligence | Action instances, delivery status donut, destinations, adaptors, actions table |
| `/ingestion` | Ingestion Pipeline | Funnel, rejections, source quality, pipeline loss |
| `/exports` | Exports | Download compliance data as CSV/JSON |

> **Global filters:** the header has a **District** dropdown + **From / To** date range. The district
> scopes every clinical page to that district's facilities (hidden on Ingestion). Adoption is no longer
> a nav page — its metrics live in the Facility Ranking.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `VITE_API_BASE_URL` | _(empty — relative)_ | Insights Service base URL. Empty = relative URLs (Caddy proxy). Set `http://localhost:8084` for local dev without Docker. |
| `VITE_AUTH_ENABLED` | `false` | Enable OAuth (demo mode = false) |
| `VITE_AUTH_TOKEN` | _(empty)_ | Static bearer token override. Falls back to sessionStorage |
| `VITE_POLLING_INTERVAL` | `60000` | Auto-refresh interval (ms) |
| `VITE_DEFAULT_DATE_RANGE_DAYS` | `180` | Default dashboard date range |

## Build & Deploy

```bash
npm run build                       # Production build → dist/
npm run preview                     # Preview production build locally

# Docker (requires cce-insights-service on deploy-scripts_cce-net)
docker compose up -d --build        # Build + deploy → http://localhost:3001
docker compose down                 # Stop
docker compose up -d --build --force-recreate  # Rebuild after code changes
```
